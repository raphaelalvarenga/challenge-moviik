            We could, for instance, begin with cleaning up our language by no longer calling a bug a bug but by calling
            it an error. It is much more honest because it squarely puts the blame where it belongs, viz. with the
            programmer who made the error. The animistic metaphor of the bug that maliciously sneaked in while the
            programmer was not looking is intellectually dishonest as it disguises that the error is the programmer's
            own creation. The nice thing of this simple change of vocabulary is that it has such a profound effect:
            while, before, a program with only one bug used to be "almost correct", afterwards a program with an error
            is just "wrong".
